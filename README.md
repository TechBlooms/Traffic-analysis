# 01 Motivation <a name = "mot"></a>
 
Knowing that traffic officers won’t have the view of the whole traffic, this project has a web-based dashboard to assist traffic officers in making decisions depending on the volume of traffic only by visualizing the count of vehicles from each lane. This would serve as a hybrid way of traffic support to the cop instead of fully automating traffic control.In this project we have also implemented the algorithm using Intel oneAPI Toolkit.

# 02 Setup <a name = "set"></a>
We have used IntelOneApi Toolkit to make the system run in any environment and it extends the code portability across all processor architectures. Hence, in our model, the usage of oneAPI served to be helpful in terms of optimization.


# 03 Implementation - Algorithm <a name = "alg"></a>
Deep Learning Algorithm - Yolov5 + Deepsort with PyTorch
The detections generated by YOLOv5, a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to a Deep Sort algorithm which tracks the objects. 
For backend, Flask and Jinga was used
For database - Firebase (No-SQL) in cloud and Sqlite in edge was used.


# 04 Deployment of OneAPI <a name = "oneapi"></a>
OneAPI is used enable the use of one platform for a range of different hardware, hence it eliminated the need for different languages, tools, and libraries when to code for CPUs and GPUs. 
Openvino was used in this project which helped in optimization of the computer vision packages that were used including OpenCV and other DL packages required for it.
